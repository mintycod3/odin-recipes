   <h4>Ingredients</h4>
   <ul>
       <li>2 (14 ounce) cans black beans, drained, rinsed, and patted dry</li>
       <li>1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
       <li>3/4 cup finely chopped bell pepper (1/2 of a pepper)</li>
       <li>1 cup finely chopped yellow onion (1/2 of a large onion)</li>
       <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (about 1 Tablespoon)</li>
       <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
       <li>1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
       <li>1/2 cup bread crumbs or oat flour</li>
       <li>1/3 cup mashed sweet potato</li>
       <li>1 Tablespoon BBQ sauce </li>
       <li>2 Tablespoons ketchup vegan mayo</li>
       <li>pinch salt + pepper</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>Instructions</h4>
   <ol>
       <li>Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Spread beans evenly onto a lined baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes until slightly dried out.</li>
       <li>Meanwhile, sauté olive oil, chopped pepper, onion, and garlic over medium heat until peppers and onions are soft, about 5-6 minutes. Gently blot some of the moisture out. Place in a large bowl or in a food processor with the remaining ingredients (cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, bread crumbs, sweet potato, BBQ sauce, ketchup, salt, and pepper). Stir or pulse everything together, then add the black beans. Mash with a fork or pulse the mixture, leaving some larger chunks of beans.</li>
       <li>Form into patties– about 1/3 cup of mixture in each.</li>
       <li>To bake: Place patties on a parchment paper lined baking sheet and bake at 375°F (191°C) for 10 minutes on each side, 20 minutes total. To grill: Place patties on greased aluminum foil and grill 8 minutes on each side. Heat temperature is personal preference as all grills differ. Generally, black bean burgers should grill on medium-high heat about 350°F (177°C) – 400°F (204°C).</li>
       <li>Serve with your favorite toppings. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
