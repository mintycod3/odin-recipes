    <h3>This is an easy vegan taco recipe that anyone can make. It is one of my favorites because it only needs five ingredients!</h3>
    <p>You can find the ingredients for this vegan tacos recipe at pretty much any grocery store near you. You won't even miss the meat because this has 13g of protein per serving. It also tastes amazing.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon taco seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon dired minced onions</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup of TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein)</li>
        <li>1(15oz) can black beans, drained</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>6 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Toppings; avocado, cilantro, salsa, limes, red onion, etc. all optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the water, taco seasoning, and onion to a boil. Add the TVP and reduce heat to low. Allow the TVP to absorb the liquid, and then add the drained black beans.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on low heat, stirring often, until the tortillas are ready-be mindful to not let the filling scorch on the bottom of the pot. Check for seasoning-add salt if needed (taco seasonings all have different salt contents so use your judgement on how much to add).</li>
        <li>Heat up the tortillas in a pan with some oil, on a grill or over your stove burner.</li>
        <li>remove the filling from the head and assemble your tacos using your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
